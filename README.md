### Hello World! üëã

## About
My name is Tara Larsen. My pronounds are she/her. Prior to my time at [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/), I was a middle school teacher who taught multiple subjects including STEM(science, technology, engineering and mathematics) classes.  I discovered software engineering when I was asked to teach an ‚ÄúIntro to Computers‚Äù class. While teaching, I gained many transferable skills that apply to software engineering.  I hold Bachelor of Science degrees in Parks and Natural Resources and Information Technology.  I am drawn to software engineering because it requires continual learning, collaboration and there are many opportunities to give back to society.

## üå± Currently Learning
Full-stack developer PERN(PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node), Linux, AWS.
